# FlipperMCE Firmware

I'm excited to present a project I've been working on for the last 6 months: **FlipperMCE**.


**FlipperMCE** is a fully open source Nintendo GameCube Memory Card Emulator (MCE), based on the famous **sd2psx** PlayStation 2 MCE designed by @xyzz.

It implements the GameCube Memory Card protocol and is able to emulate cards from 59 blocks (0.5 MB / 4 MBit) up to 1019 blocks (8 MB / 64 MBit).

Each card image is saved as a dedicated *.raw* file in its respective folder on the SD card.



## Features

- Emulation of cards from 59 to 1019 blocks
- GameID supplied by Swiss or any other game loader that supports it (CubeBoot, Nintendont, etc.)
- Multi-region support (creates new cards in either JPN or World encoding)

For more info, see [Features](features.md).
