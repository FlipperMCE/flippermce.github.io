# FlipperMCE Firmware

I'm excited to present you a project I've been working on the last 6 months: **FlipperMCE**.

**FlipperMCE** is a fully Open Source Nintendo GameCube Memory Card Emulator (MCE), based on the famous **sd2psx** Playstation 2 MCE designed by @xyzz.

It implements the GameCube Memory Card protocol and therefore is able to emulate cards from 59 Blocks (0.5 MB / 4 MBit) up to 1019 Blocks (8 MB / 64 MBit).

Every Card image is saved as a dedicated *.raw* file in the respective folder on SD card.


## üöÄ Features

- Emulation of Cards from 59 Blocks - 1019 Blocks
- GameID supplied by swiss or any other Game Loader that supports it (CubeBoot, Nintendont, ...)
- BootCard support (boot to cards in BOOT/ folder if activated)
- Multi Region support (creates new cards either in JPN or World encoding)

For more info, see [Features](features.md)
